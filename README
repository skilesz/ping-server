This program pings specified hostname by sending ECHO_REQUESTs and receiving ECHO_REPLYs. It displays the RTTs and provides
a report upon termination detailing the packets sent, received, packet loss percentage, total time, and the average RTT. TTL
can also be specified in a second command line argument.

NOTE: Must be run by user with permissions to create a SOCKET_RAW. Tested by running
sudo ./ping_server <host_name> <ttl_val>
